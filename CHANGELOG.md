# Changelog

All notable changes to **sparkDash** are documented here.  
The README [Latest version changelog](./README.md#latest-version-changelog) always reflects only the current release; this file keeps the full history.

## [1.1.5] — 2026-07-21

### Added
- **LLM decode benchmark**
  - **Run decode benchmark** on each LLM panel (when a model is available)
  - Multi-select **concurrency** levels (`1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, 32`); default selection **1, 2**
  - Levels run **one after another**; within a level, N streams fire together
  - Each concurrent stream uses a **distinct JSON/HTML write-style prompt** (higher decode tok/s workloads)
  - Configurable **max tokens per stream** (default **500**, range 64–2048); input allows clearing digits while typing
  - Async jobs: `POST` starts → poll status; one active bench per Spark; cancel supported
  - Results show **Server tok/s** (live-style engine counter samples, same idea as Generation tok/s) and **Per-stream** decode after first token, plus TTFT and stream OK counts
  - Last run **persisted** (`config/bench-history.json`) and restored when reopening the dialog (survives refresh / restart)
  - Mobile-friendly solid sheet (portaled to `document.body`, scrollable body, sticky footer)
- **Remove additional LLM ports** — only non-primary ports show **Remove**; server rejects deleting the first port

### Fixed
- **GB10 GPU used / process list** (unified memory + Docker)
  - Host helper `config/gpu-memory.sh` writes safe JSON: used sum, **MemTotal** as pool size, process list (Python JSON; env-configurable path)
  - `SystemCollector` hydrates process cache from `gpu-memory.json` when in-container `compute-apps` is empty
  - Generated `config/gpu-memory.json` gitignored and no longer tracked
  - Supersedes contributor PR #10 (no machine-specific SSH mounts in compose)
- **Mobile Edit / Add Spark dialogs** — solid max-height sheet, scrollable form, sticky actions, body scroll lock (can reach all fields on phone)

### Notes
- Decode bench hits the real LLM endpoint over LAN; use off-peak for high concurrency.
- Host cron for GPU file (example): `* * * * * /path/to/sparkDash/config/gpu-memory.sh` with `./config` bind-mounted into Docker.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Power management**
  - Per-Spark **Shutdown** and **Wake** controls in the Spark header
  - Overview **Shutdown All** (online Sparks only) and **Wake All**
  - Shutdown runs over SSH: `sudo -n /usr/local/bin/spark-shutdown` (install that script on each host with passwordless sudo for it)
  - Shared Wake-on-LAN helper (`server/wol.js`): MAC validation, `/24` broadcast from LAN IP (fallback `255.255.255.255`), single-settlement UDP send
- **Wake-on-LAN MAC**
  - Auto-detect MAC of the **enP7s7** interface during network polls (local + remote)
  - Persist as `detectedMacAddress` for use when the node is offline
  - Optional **MAC override** in Edit Spark (`macAddress`); Wake uses override → detected → request body
- **Worker node**
  - Edit Spark checkbox **Worker node** (with info tooltip)
  - When set: LLM panels and “Add LLM port” are hidden; LLM ports are not probed
  - **Worker node** badge in the Spark header
- README notes for power controls and LAN trust model for power APIs

### Notes
- Power APIs are unauthenticated like the rest of the dashboard — keep port **5555** on a trusted network only.

## [1.0.5] — 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Multiple LLM ports** — monitor several LLM servers on different ports simultaneously (each port gets its own panel and backend detection)
- **GPU processes** — top GPU processes by VRAM usage (name, PID, memory) in the GPU panel
- **Spark uptime** — system uptime badge inline on each Spark header

### Backend (summary)
- `SparkRegistry`: `llmPorts` array with migration from legacy `llmPort`
- `SparkMonitor`: `Map<port, LlmProbe>` for parallel multi-port polling
- `SystemCollector`: process list via `nvidia-smi`
- API: `PUT` / `POST` / `DELETE` LLM port endpoints
